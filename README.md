# Wildcat-Correction
Group project for EECS 330 Human-Computer Interaction

Created as an add-on for Northwestern's Wildcat Connection page. Currently Wildcat Connection is the only place online where Northwestern students can find all student organizations on campus. However, it lists clubs in a confusing way and has no way to be personalized for a user's interests.

Wildcat Correction remedies this by performing three tasks: <br />
  1) Allows students to take a survey using an embedded Typeform quiz which will then return the names of student organizations that match their interests. <br />
  2) Allows organization leaders to log in as an admin to view the statistics for the survey. This will allow org leaders to see what characteristics of a club new students are interested in (committment level, group-based, project-based, etc) and possibly incorporate that in their advertising or even change what the club does. <br />
  3) Offers a "Categories" page which separates all organizations on campus into an easy to read table. Users can then click on whichever club category interests them to be taken to the page on Wildcat Connection where all clubs of this type are listed. <br />
  
Note: This project was focused on front-end development and UI appeal. It lacks any true back-end and elements such as they survey and statistics page return phony results.
